## Social Media
-   [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/aebrer.xyz) my main social media in use
-   [mastodon](https://genart.social/@aebrer) less popular but I visit from time to time
-   [github](https://github.com/aebrer) open source code and some other things
-   [tzprofiles signed identity statements](https://tzprofiles.com/view/tz1ZBMhTa7gxSpaeXoqyc6bTCrxEHfZYSpPt) use these as “gold standard” to verify my identity when needed

## Current Projects
- Recently participated in #Art4Artist, a collective art show with 40 artists where profits were split between us all evenly. https://bsky.app/profile/aebrer.xyz/post/3lbmtdhxrfs2g
- Otherwise, focused on the occasional one-off piece, busy with work IRL among other things.

## Portfolio Stuff
-   [my latest mints on Teia.art](https://teia.art/aebrer) Teia, where I minted lots of experimental and prototype stuff, as well as some of my favorite projects
-   [objkt.com profile](https://objkt.com/@aebrer) the most generally reliable place to view (almost all) of my tezos art (and thus the bulk of my art)
-   [opensea profile](https://opensea.io/aebrer/created) I've minted a few things on ETH or Base lately, you can view them here
-   [deja hue](https://app.manifold.xyz/c/deja-hue) another in the screensaver series, this time minted on Manifold
-   [The Trace Gallery collection and full game ](https://teia.art/collab/the_trace_gallery)I put together everything I learned in one year working on my art and my Pico-8 development skills, to make this game. It’s a unique generative art experience, different each time you play it. Experience the weird mystery of The Trace Gallery, and the amazing soundtrack by Carson Kompon.
  +  [Direct link to the playable game](https://teia.art/objkt/717500)
-   [ideocartography\_realized ](https://teia.art/collab/ideocartography_realized)my ongoing AI art project, in which I take the generative ideocartography pieces from fx(hash), interpret them, and then get an AI model to realize the vision as I see it (while making sure it stays similar to the pixelart source); check the description on Teia to find links to the previous pieces in the series
