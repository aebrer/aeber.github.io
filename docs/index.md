## Social Media
-   [twitter](https://twitter.com/aebrer) wish this site was better :(
-   [warpcast/farcaster](https://warpcast.com/aebrer) trying it out for now
-   [kbin](https://kbin.social/u/aebrer) check out kbin.social/m/genart to see our small but growing genart community
-   [github](https://github.com/aebrer) open source code and some other things
-   [tzprofiles signed identity statements](https://tzprofiles.com/view/tz1ZBMhTa7gxSpaeXoqyc6bTCrxEHfZYSpPt) use these as “gold standard” to verify my identity when needed

## Current Projects
-   [aebrer_screensavers](https://teia.art/collab/aebrer_screensavers) a project about generative and interactive screensavers on teia.art

## Portfolio Stuff
-   [objkt.com profile](https://objkt.com/@aebrer) the most generally reliable place to view (almost all) of my tezos art
-   [my latest mints on Teia.art](https://teia.art/aebrer/created) Teia, where I minted lots of experimental and prototype stuff, as well as some of my favorite projects
-   [The Trace Gallery collection and full game ](https://teia.art/collab/the_trace_gallery)I put together everything I learned in one year working on my art and my Pico-8 development skills, to make this game. It’s a unique generative art experience, different each time you play it. Experience the weird mystery of The Trace Gallery, and the amazing soundtrack by Carson Kompon.
-   [ideocartography\_realized ](https://teia.art/collab/ideocartography_realized)my ongoing AI art project, in which I take the generative ideocartography pieces from fx(hash), interpret them, and then get an AI model to realize the vision as I see it (while making sure it stays similar to the pixelart source); check the description on Teia to find links to the previous pieces in the series
-   [my profile on Versum](https://versum.xyz/user/tz1ZBMhTa7gxSpaeXoqyc6bTCrxEHfZYSpPt/created)

-   [Neoretro Creative Coding discord community ](https://discord.gg/rdqFhxVd89)a positive vibes discord for hanging out, sharing projects, and developing art and games; no gatekeeping
-   [my profile on Rarible ](https://rarible.com/aebrer/created)I don’t mint much on here, not decentralized enough IMO, but there are some things I do love a lot there

-   [my profile on AB2 Gallery ](https://ab2.gallery/address/YLVFL76O23XTPRNB2BBY3MLXJ4P7KP4B5OYTLDIYAVPBWC5FWZELXW4J6I)haven’t minted on anything but Tezos for a long time, but I did dabble briefly on Algorand
